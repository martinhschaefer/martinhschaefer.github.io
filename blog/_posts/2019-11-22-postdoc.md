Do you wonder why the molecular alteration profiles of tumors differ so much from tissue to tissue? 
Are you curious how the microbiome contributes to cancer initiation and progression? 
Are you interested in epigenetics and would like to better understand how epigenetic changes can have an 
impact on the fitness of cancer cells? Are you computational biologist looking for a PostDoc position? 
Then you should get in touch with us. We are currently looking for a postdoctoral fellow who will work within 
the AIRC-funded research project "Interactions between tumor and microenvironment: contributions to 
molecular alterations and cancer subtype localization".
