I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering from the University of Roma “La Sapienza.” I am currently enrolled in the joint Master's degree program in “Bioinformatics for Computational Genomics” (BCG) offered by Politecnico di Milano and Università degli Studi di Milano. I joined Martin Schaefer's lab (IEO) for my curricular internship, where I am working on a project focused on protein interaction networks, aiming to disentangle the extent to which biological, technical, and study bias factors determine their degree distribution.
