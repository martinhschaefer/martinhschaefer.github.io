Gökçe Senger is a graduate student in Schaefer Lab at the European Oncology Institute. Gökçe completed her undergraduate studies and graduated from the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics at the Izmir Institute of Technology, Turkey. As a summer intern at the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University in 2015, she worked on the comparative analysis of modern and ancient bacterial homolog proteins in the aspect of evolutionary biology. Afterward, she completed her Master of Science’s degree in Bioinformatics program under the Informatics Institute at Middle East Technical University, in Turkey. In her master thesis, she worked on network modelling of transcription regulation systems in Glioblastoma Stem Cells (GSCs) by integrating transcriptomic, epigenomic and interactome data. Her research interests lie in the area of bioinformatics and evolutionary biology and she is specifically interested in transcriptional regulation mechanisms and their evolution.
