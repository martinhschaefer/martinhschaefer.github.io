I hold a Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences from the University of Siena, where I conducted a transcriptomic analysis of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells. Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing a Master's in Bioinformatics for Computational Genomics at the University of Milan, in collaboration with the Politecnico di Milano, focusing on machine learning, genomics, and epigenomics.

I am currently working as an intern in the lab of Martin Schaefer at the European Institute of Oncology (IEO), where I focus on integrating multiple data types to investigate the contribution of individual genes in copy number altered regions to cancer. My master thesis aims to refine machine learning models to identify key cancer drivers and understand the selective pressures acting on specific regions.
