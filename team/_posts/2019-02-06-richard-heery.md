I am a graduate student in the Schaefer group at the European Institute of Oncology. 

I received my Bachelor’s degree form University College Dublin, majoring in Genetics. Afterwards, I completed a Master’s degree in Translational Oncology at Trinity College, Dublin. As part of my thesis here, I investigated the role of long non-coding RNAs in lung cancer and mesothelioma. Around this time, I became very intrigued by the developments in the field of bioinformatics and realized that the potential it has to contribute to both the diagnosis and treatment of cancer is enormous. Hence, I chose to pursue another Master’s degree in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at University College Cork. Currently, I am investigating different methods to analyse the role of DNA methylation during tumorigenesis.
