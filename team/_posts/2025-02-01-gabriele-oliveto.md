I'm Gabriele and I work as an intern in Martin Schaefer's lab at the Istituto Europeo di Oncologia (IEO). 
I come from a biological background, holding a Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences at University of Milan: during my thesis there, I focused on plant genetics and epigenetics, focusing in particular on the PRC2 complex in A.thaliana.
Right now, I am attending a Master's degree in Bioinformatics for Computational Genomics at the University of Milan in collaboration with Politecnico di Milano. My master thesis project at IEO aims at trying to predict chromatin accessibility changes during tumor onset, by building and refining a machine learning model, that will hopefully allow us to discover interesting chromatin accessibility changes under selective pressure.
