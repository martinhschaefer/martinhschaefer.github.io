I am a PhD student at the European School of Molecular Medicine (SEMM) at the European Institute of Oncology (IEO) in Milan under the supervision of Martin Schaefer. 
I received my Bachelor’s degree in Medical and Pharmaceutical Biotechnology from the University of Bari, followed by a Master’s in Molecular Biotechnology and Bioinformatics from the University of Milan. During my master’s, I worked in Matteo Chiara’s lab at University of Milan, where I explored Oxford Nanopore single-molecule RNA-seq data and evaluated computational tools for transcriptome reconstruction. 
Subsequently, I joined MD Francesco Benedetti’s lab at Ospedale San Raffaele in Milan as part of a Horizon project aimed at predicting peripartum depression through Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) calculations on diverse cohorts of European mothers. At San Raffaele, I also collaborated with Luca Colnaghi’s group to investigate the transcriptional interplay between Parkinson’s disease and various cancers.
Currently, my research focuses on identifying epigenetic alterations under selection and deciphering their role in driving tumor evolution from normal tissue to metastasis.
