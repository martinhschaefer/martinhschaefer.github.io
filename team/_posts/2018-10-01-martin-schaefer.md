I'm group leader at the [European Institute of Oncology](www.ieo.it) in the [Department of Experimental Oncology](https://www.ieo.it/it/ricerca/Ricerca-di-base/Dipartimento-di-Oncologia-Sperimentale/) and assistant professor at the [European School of Molecular Medicine](http://www.semm.it/). 

I received my diploma from the University of Tübingen and did my PhD work at the Max Delbrück Center in Berlin under supervision of [Miguel Andrade](https://cbdm.uni-mainz.de/). I then moved to Barcelona where I worked at the Centre for Genomic Regulation in the lab of [Luis Serrano](http://serranolab.crg.eu/) first as a PostDoc and then as a staff scientist.
