I'm a post-doctoral researcher studying systematic bias in PPI networks with the goal to model and correct it. The consequences of these biases are miss-identification and obscuring meaningful biological patterns.
During my PhD I studied pharmacogenomics with the goal of finding genetic biomarkers predisposing specific adverse drug reactions such as atypical femur fractures, drug induced pancreatitis and CNS-toxic reactions.
I obtained both my PhD degree and  my master degree in biotechnical and bioinformatical engineering at Uppsala University in Sweden.
