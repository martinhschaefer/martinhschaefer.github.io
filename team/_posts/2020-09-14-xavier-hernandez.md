I am an external PhD student based in the Center for Genomic Regulation (CRG, Barcelona) and co-supervised by Martin Schaefer and Luis Serrano. My research interest is to unravel the intricate mechanisms that link genotype and perturbations to specific phenotypes, such as diseases, which is essential to develop accurate predictive tests and effective therapies. In particular, my project aims to elucidate the role of changes in tRNA levels, modifications and aminoacylation on the regulation of translation across different conditions and tissues. Using a systems biology approach, we intend to shed light on the underlying mechanisms driving the dynamical adaptation between codon usage and tRNAomes.
