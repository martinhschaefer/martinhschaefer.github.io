I am an undergraduate student at the University of Glasgow, graduating this summer with a major in Genetics, and planning on beginning a Masters in Bioinformatics in the fall. I completed my undergraduate thesis on the effect of regeneration on telomere dynamics by comparing the extent of telomere attrition in pristine and regenerated tails in the common lizard, thus exploring how this model animal escapes molecular ageing and its relationship to the hallmarks of cancer. Throughout my degree I’ve had hands-on experience with bioinformatics tools and have been most interested in my Cancer Molecular Biology course, I was therefore keen to join Martin Schaefer’s lab for the summer of 2020. Here, I will help investigate how viral infections affect tumour DNA methylation profiles.
