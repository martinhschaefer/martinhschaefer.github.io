I am a master's student at Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg,
currently conducting my master's thesis project in Schaefer Lab at the
European Institute of Oncology (IEO).

My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical
Engineering at Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen followed by a
Master's degree in Biomedical Microsystems Engineering, which I'm
currently pursuing. My experience as a research assistant at the
University of Freiburg, where I engaged in data analysis and
statistics, combined with coursework on genetics and next-generation
sequencing, sparked my interest and passion for the field of
computational genomics. I strongly believe that the integration of
machine learning and data analysis can drive significant advancements
in biomedical research.

My current project in Martin Schaefer's lab is primarily focused on the
computational analysis of aneuploidy and assessing the selective nature
of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.
