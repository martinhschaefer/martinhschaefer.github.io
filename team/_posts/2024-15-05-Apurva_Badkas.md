I have a mixed background in engineering and biology. I obtained a bachelorâ€™s degree from University of Pune (India) and Masters in Chemical engineering from the University of Cincinnati (US). This masters project explored antibody-nanoparticle based drug delivery for cancer. There were two research stints at the National Chemical Laboratory, Pune (India), at the department of Chemical Engineering and Process Development: one dealing with process development (poly-lactic acid) and the other in dynamical modeling of enzyme-substrate complexes. I also obtained a masters in Integrated Systems Biology at the University of Luxembourg, followed on by doctoral training. Both the masters project and the doctoral thesis focused on the use of protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) for novel disease-associated protein identification and drug response prediction. As a part of the post-doctoral research in the lab of Dr. Martin Schaefer (IEO), the project looks at PPINs from the perspective of improving the understanding of inherent biases in the publicly-available PPI databases and accounting for these biases in their applications.
