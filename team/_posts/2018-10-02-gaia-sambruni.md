I am a PhD student in the European School of Molecular Medicine (SEMM) in System Medicine at the European Institute of Oncology (IEO), enrolled in the computational biology program. My studies in natural science and biology led me to focus on genomics and bioinformatics, the fields I am most interested in. My involvement in these areas increased while analyzing NGS data during my master's thesis at Giulio Pavesi's Lab (Universit√† Statale di Milano), where I learned to use programming as powerful tools to interpret biological data. Then I joined Stefano Campaner's Lab (Istituto Italiano di tecnologia, IIT) in which I studied the identification of transcription factor networks involved in cell transformation with *in silico* approaches. This great experience inspired me to pursue an academic career in cancer genomics. My current work in Martin Schaefer's Lab (IEO) is focused on the use of computational methods to clarify the role of the environment of a tumor during cancer evolution.
