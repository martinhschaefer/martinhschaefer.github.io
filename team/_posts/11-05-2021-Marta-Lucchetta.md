I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Schaefer group at the European Institute of Oncology (IEO).

I received my master’s degree in Bioinformatics from the University of Rome ‘Tor Vergata’. I carried out my master’s thesis at the Danish Cancer Society Research Center in Copenhagen and after that, I worked as Research Assistant for one year. In this period, my research was focused on the analysis of the RNA-Seq gene expression data. I analyzed data from cancer patients using different bioinformatics approaches (from differential expression analysis to survival analysis).

Afterward, I completed my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics at the Department of Informatics and Telematics of the National Council of Research in Pisa, focusing my attention on computational network biology.

My task at Martin Schaefer’s lab is to develop and apply network-based methods to identify cancer driver events from genomic and epigenomic data.
