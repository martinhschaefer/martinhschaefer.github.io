I am a PhD student at the European School of Molecular Medicine (SEMM) at the European Institute of Oncology (IEO) in Milan. I am currently enrolled in the System Medicine, Computational Biology program under the supervision of Martin Schaefer.

I received my Bachelor’s degree in Biological Sciences from University of Pisa, focusing my attention of neurobiology and biochemistry. Subsequently, I moved to the University of Milan where I got my Master’s in Molecular Biotechnology and Bioinformatics. During the master’s, my interests shifted from experimental to computational biology, joining Luisa Lanfrancone’s group (IEO) under the supervision of Giulio Pavesi (University of Milan). Here, I investigated the role of druggable genes during melanoma evolution and progression using in-vivo shRNA-screening and single-cell transcriptomics.
