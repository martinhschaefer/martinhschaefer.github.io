I am an undergraduate student at the University of Bologna, graduating this summer in Genomics. During my academic career I gained mathematical and statistical skills for the computational analysis of the biological ‘omics’ areas. 

I am carrying out my curricular internship at Martin Schaefer’s Lab (IEO), where my project is based on the study of associations between the presence of viral reads and clinical and molecular tumor features.
