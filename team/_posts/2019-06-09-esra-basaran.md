I am an undergraduate student at the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics at Middle East Technical University, in Turkey. 
Besides, I am working with Assoc. Prof. Nurcan Tunçbağ’s lab in which we are focusing on network modeling and protein structures. 
I gained experience with sequence alignments, differential expression analyses by using bioinformatics tools, and I have also 
learned about basic concepts of the prediction of protein structures. Accordingly, my interest in the bioinformatics field 
increased. In June 2019, I joined Martin Schaefer’s Lab at the European Oncology Institute in Italy as an intern. My work here 
is to focus on small non-coding RNAs, miRNAs, in colon cancer.
