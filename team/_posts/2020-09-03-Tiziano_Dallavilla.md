I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Schaefer group at the European Institute of Oncology (IEO). 

I got my bachelor's in industrial and environmental biotechnology at the University of Milan. As part of my thesis, I investigated metaheuristic procedures for finding optimal parameters in kinetic models. Afterward, I completed my Master's degree in Bioinformatics at the University of Milano Bicocca, where I focused my studies on intracellular signaling cascades using systems biology approaches. Bioinformatics opened my eyes to the concept of life as complex interactions within biological systems, which led me to begin a Ph.D.in Bioengineering at Ècole Polytechnique Fèdèrale de Lausanne. After my Ph.D. I decided to widen my Bioinformatics expertise by studying methods for the analysis of NGS data applied to the study of cancer and rare genetic diseases. 

My task at Martin Schaefer's lab is to investigate how different environmental features like microbiome or virome affects the carcinogenesis of different tumor subtypes.
