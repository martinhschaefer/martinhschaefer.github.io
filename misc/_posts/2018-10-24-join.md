We are hiring two early-career scientists with a strong computational background. We are looking for talented and interested candidates on either pre- or postdoctoral level (PhD students and PostDocs). Candidates should have expertise in statistics, programming and the analysis of omics data (ideally from tumor samples). Projects will be in collaboration with experimental groups and therefore require cross-disciplinary skills. 

The aim of the open positions is to further the understanding of cancer evolution by developing methods that allow to identify epigenetic cancer driver events and applying these methods to experimental and clinical data. In particular, we encourage researchers with interest in either network biology or population genetics to apply.

The [European Institute of Oncology (IEO)](http://www.ieo.it) is one of Europeâ€™s leading cancer research institutes in a central location of Milan. It hosts an international and vibrant research community. The IEO provides postgraduate education through the European School of Molecular Medicine [SEMM](http://www.semm.it) with a PhD program in Systems Medicine (including a computiational biology track). The IEO has an excellent HPC infrastructure and a growing computational biology community.

For more information or for sending an application (which should include a CV, cover letter, expected availability date, a list of publications and contact details of 2 - 3 referees) please contact: martin.schaefer@ieo.it

We also offer the possibility for undergraduate students to do their master thesis or an internship in our lab.
