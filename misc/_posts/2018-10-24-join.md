We are looking for a highly motivated postdoctoral fellow to join our lab.

The aim of the open positions is to further the understanding of cancer evolution by developing methods that allow to identify epigenetic cancer driver events and applying these methods to experimental and clinical data. Specifically, the aim of the project is to apply the methods to tumors from different tissues and from different positions of the same tissue to identify alterations that are tissue- and position-specific with the ultimate goal of explaining determinants of this specificity. 

Candidates should hold a PhD (in a relevant area) and have expertise in statistics, programming and the analysis of omics data (ideally from tumor samples).

The successful candidate will receive a three year fellowship (1+2); the initial contract is for 1 year with a possibility of extension.

The [European Institute of Oncology (IEO)](http://www.ieo.it) is one of Europeâ€™s leading cancer research institutes. The lab is in the Department of Experimental Oncology (DEO), which is located on the IFOM-IEO campus in a central location of Milan. It hosts an international and vibrant research community (with a growing computational component). It is strong in genomics analyses, clinical aspects and mechanistic understanding of cancer. The IEO has an excellent HPC infrastructure and core facilities. It provides postgraduate education through the European School of Molecular Medicine [SEMM](http://www.semm.it) with a PhD program in Systems Medicine (including a computational biology track).

For more information or for sending an application (which should include a CV, cover letter, expected availability date, a list of publications and contact details of 2 - 3 referees) please contact: martin.schaefer@ieo.it. The position is available immediately but the starting date can be negotiated.

Applications for PhD positions are also welcome. Additionally, we offer the possibility for undergraduate students to do their master thesis or an internship in our lab.
