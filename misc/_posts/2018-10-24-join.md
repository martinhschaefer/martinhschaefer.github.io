### Positions in our lab

#### Postdoctoral or PhD position in computational network biology
We are seeking a highly motivated **postdoctoral researcher** or **PhD student** with a strong computational background to join our research project on protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Our research addresses critical challenges in network biology, with a specific focus on enhancing the reliability and interpretability of protein-protein interaction data.
Project overview:
Protein-protein interaction networks are key to understanding biological and disease processes, but current methods to detect, integrate and analyze those networks suffer from high technical error rates and biases, particularly due to the overrepresentation of frequently studied proteins. In a joint project with the Friedrich Alexander University (Erlangen, Germany) and the Technical University of Munich (Germany), we aim to improve the quality of PPI networks by leveraging large scale experimental information towards two key objectives:
Developing a negative gold standard for PPI prediction: We will create a robust set of pairs of proteins that are highly unlikely to interact, providing essential negative examples for machine learning models.
Mitigating the study bias in PPI networks: We will implement methods to characterize and reduce the impact of [over-testing certain proteins](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.17.533165v2), ultimately improving the accuracy and reliability of PPI networks.
More information related to the project and our consortium can be found at: <www.cobinet.ai>.
What we offer:
World-class research environment: The IEO, located on the IFOM-IEO campus in central Milan, is renowned for its excellence in cancer research, with a strong emphasis on genomics, clinical applications, and the mechanistic understanding of cancer biology.
Collaborative and diverse team: You’ll be part of a dynamic, interdisciplinary and international community that fosters collaboration between computational and experimental scientists. The candidate will work closely together with Ph.D. students and postdocs in Erlangen and Munich, Germany.
State-of-the-art infrastructure: Access to excellent HPC infrastructure and core facilities, ensuring you have the resources to excel in your research.
Learning opportunities: You will receive close supervision and mentorship, with significant opportunities to expand your expertise in network biology, machine learning, and programming.
More information on our institute can be found here: <www.research.ieo.it>.

##### Requirements:
* For postdoc candidates: PhD in Bioinformatics, Computer Science, Biophysics or a related field.
* For PhD candidates: Master in a computational discipline.
* Background in machine learning and network biology.
* Proficiency in programming languages (e.g., Python, R).
* Experience with large-scale data analysis and high-performance computing.
* Enthusiasm for learning and applying new computational methods to biological questions.

##### How to apply:
Interested candidates should send a CV, cover letter, and the contact details of at least two referees to <martin.schaefer@ieo.it>. Also informal queries are very welcome and more information will be provided. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis until the position is filled.

#### Bachelor and master theses

We are always looking for **bachelor and master students** interested in doing their thesis or internships with us. Please directly contact: martin.schaefer@ieo.it.
