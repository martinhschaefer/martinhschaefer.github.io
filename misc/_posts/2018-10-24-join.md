We are hiring two early-career scientists with a strong computational background. We are looking for talented and interested candidates on either pre- or postdoctoral level. Candidates should have expertise in statistics, programming and the analysis of molecular cancer data. Projects will be in collaboration with experimental groups and therefore require cross-disciplinary skills. The aim of the open positions is to further the understanding of cancer evolution by developing methods that allow to identify epigenetic cancer driver events and applying these methods to experimental and clinical data. In particular, we encourage researchers with interest in either network biology or population genetics to apply.

The European Institute of Oncology is one of Europeâ€™s leading cancer research institutes in a central location of Milan. It hosts an international research community. It provides postgraduate education through the European School of Molecular Medicine [SEMM](http://www.semm.it) with a PhD program in Systems Medicine.

For more information or for sending an application (which should include a CV, cover letter, expected availability date, a list of publications and contact details of 2 - 3 referees) please contact: martin.schaefer@ieo.it
