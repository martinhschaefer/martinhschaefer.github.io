### Positions in our lab

#### PhD position in tumor epigenome evolution

Are you passionate about uncovering the hidden drivers of cancer evolution? Join the computational cancer biology lab of Martin Schaefer as a **PhD student**, where you’ll develop models of tumor epigenome evolution to identify epigenetic drivers of late stage carcinogenesis.
##### Project overview:
Cancer is driven by alterations on all molecular levels. While our knowledge about the contribution of point mutations to the phenotypic hallmarks of cancer has advanced substantially over the last decade, we still need to solve the puzzle of how the numerous quantitative changes (eg epigenetic or transcriptional) are related to cancer initiation and progression. We are looking for a computational postdoc to develop models of selection to identify epigenetic drivers of carcinogenesis. 

Your work will contribute to solving one of the most critical puzzles in cancer biology - linking quantitative molecular changes to cancer initiation and progression - by analyzing cutting-edge data types such as WGBS, EM-seq, and ONT sequencing generated from our in-house cohort of gastrointestinal cancer patients. On the methodological site, this project will combine methods from machine learning and population genomics. 

Your role will involve investigating key questions such as:
* Identifying alterations under selection in late-stage tumors.
* Understanding how epigenetic changes facilitate adaptation to metastatic niches.
* Exploring how selection pressures reveal tumor vulnerabilities.

The successful candidate will work together in close collaboration with other members of the lab as well as with wet lab and clinical collaborators.
