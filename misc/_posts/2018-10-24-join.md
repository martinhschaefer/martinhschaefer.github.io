#### Postdoctoral position in computational biology at the IEO in Milan

We are looking for a highly motivated postdoctoral fellow to join the new computational cancer biology lab of Martin Schaefer at the European Institute of Oncology (IEO) in Milan. The position is funded by a 5 year AIRC grant to Martin Schaefer.

We aim to develop an understanding of cancer as a complex and evolving system. The aim of this position is to study the interaction of tumor cells with the local microbiome and other components of the microenvironment. The project will involve developing computational methods for the analysis of sequencing data and applying them to multi-omics data from clinical and laboratory samples.

The [European Institute of Oncology (IEO)](http://www.ieo.it) is one of Europeâ€™s leading cancer research institutes. The lab is in the Department of Experimental Oncology (DEO), which is located on the IFOM-IEO campus in a central location of Milan. Milan is an international city with a [high quality of life](https://italofile.com/italy-quality-of-life/). The IEO hosts an international and vibrant research community (with a growing computational component). It is strong in genomics analyses, clinical aspects and mechanistic understanding of cancer. The IEO has an excellent HPC infrastructure and core facilities.

Candidates should hold a PhD (in a relevant area), have expertise in statistics, programming and the analysis of omics data and have a basic understanding of human molecular biology. Knowledge of data science techniques such as machine learning and being familiar with concepts of tumor evolution are a plus.

A competitive salary will be paid based on the qualification of the applicant. Non-Italian as well as Italian applicants who spent more than 3 years working outside Italy will benefit from a tax exemption for the first 3 years.

For more information on the position or for sending an application (which should include a CV, cover letter, a list of publications and contact details of 2 - 3 referees) please contact: martin.schaefer@ieo.it. The position is available immediately but the starting date can be negotiated. The **deadline for applications is March 6 2019**.


#### Other positions in the lab

Applications for PhD and bioinformatics technician positions are also welcome. Additionally, we offer the possibility for undergraduate students to do their master thesis or an internship in our lab.
