#### Positions in our lab

## Postdoc position

We are looking for a highly motivated and talented **computational postdoctoral researcher** to work with us. The postdoc will develop and apply network-based methods to identify cancer driver events from genomic and epigenomic data.

Cancer is driven by alterations on all molecular levels. However, while our knowledge about the contribution of point mutations to the phenotypic hallmarks of cancer has advanced substantially over the last decade, we still need to solve the puzzle of how the numerous quantitative changes (eg epigenetic or translational) and copy number changes of larger genomic regions are related to cancer initiation and progression. Our lab employs methods from the fields of population genetics and network biology to address three questions:

1. Which of the many molecular changes are driver events contributing to cancer?
2. How do cancer cells tolerate the large quantity of molecular alterations?
3. How does the tissue environment shapes the way in which the tumor develops?

The successful candidate will work together with other members of the lab as well as with wet lab and clinical collaborators to develop and employ network biology methods to a) model interactions between alterations on different molecular levels and b) systematically identify network level selection in cancer.

The European Institute of Oncology (IEO) is one of Europeâ€™s leading cancer research institutes. The lab is in the Department of Experimental Oncology (DEO), which is located on the IFOM-IEO campus in a central location of Milan. The IEO hosts an international and vibrant research community (with a growing computational component). It is strong in genomics analyses, clinical aspects and mechanistic understanding of cancer. The IEO has an excellent HPC infrastructure and core facilities.
Candidates should hold a PhD (in a relevant area), have expertise in statistics, programming, and the analysis of cancer omics data. Interest in network biology and knowledge of data science techniques such as machine learning and being familiar with concepts of tumor evolution are a plus. 

A competitive salary will be paid based on the qualification of the applicant. Non-Italian as well as Italian applicants who recently spent more than 3 years working outside Italy will benefit from a tax exemption for the first 3 years.
For informal inquiries or to send an application (which should include a CV, cover letter, a list of publications and contact details of 2 - 3 referees) please contact: martin.schaefer@ieo.it. The position is available immediately but the starting date can be negotiated.

## Bachelor and master thesis

We are also looking for **bachelor or master students** interested in doing their thesis or internships with us. Please directly contact: martin.schaefer@ieo.it.

## PhD positions

Candidates interested in doing a **PhD** with us should take a look at the PhD program in systems medicine at the [European School of Molecular Medicine (SEMM)](http://www.semm.it/education/prospective-students/phd-program-systems-medicine). The next call closes in July 2020.
