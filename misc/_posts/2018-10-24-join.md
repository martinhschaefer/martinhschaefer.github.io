### Positions in our lab

#### Postdoc position

The Computational Cancer Biology lab of Martin Schaefer is recruiting a **computational postdoctoral researcher**.

Cancer is driven by alterations on all molecular levels. While our knowledge about the contribution of point mutations to the phenotypic hallmarks of cancer has advanced substantially over the last decade, we still need to solve the puzzle of how the numerous quantitative changes (eg epigenetic or transcriptional) are related to cancer initiation and progression. We are looking for a computational postdoc to develop models of selection to identify epigenetic drivers of carcinogenesis. This is related to our previous work, in particular: [Heery and Schaefer. NAR. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab1167) and [Alfieri, Caravagna and Schaefer. Nat Comm. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-39313-8).

The successful candidate will work together with other members of the lab as well as with wet lab and clinical collaborators.

Candidates should hold a PhD in bioinformatics/computational biology, biostatistics, computer science or a related field. They should have expertise in statistics, programming, and the analysis of cancer omics data. Interest in network biology and knowledge of data science techniques such as machine learning and being familiar with concepts of tumor evolution are a plus.

At first, a one-year fellowship will be granted, with possible extensions.

For informal inquiries or to send an application (which should include a CV, cover letter, a list of publications and contact details of 2 - 3 referees) please contact: martin.schaefer@ieo.it. The position is available immediately.

#### Bioinformatician

We are looking for a highly motivated and talented **Bioinformatician** to work with us. The successful candidate will work on the integration and analysis of publicly available and in-house generated omics data. The job will include the implimentation of novel pipelines and algorithms for the interpretation of cancer omics data.

What we are looking for: 
- good programming skills
- familiarity with Linux, cloud computing or computer clusters required
- experience in analysing sequencing data or implementing bioinformatics pipelines is a plus

Candidates should hold a Master in bioinformatics/computational biology, biostatistics or computer science (or related fields).

For informal inquiries or to send an application (which should include a CV, cover letter and contact details of 1 - 2 referees) please contact: martin.schaefer@ieo.it. The position is available immediately.


#### PhD positions

Candidates interested in doing a **PhD** with us should apply through the PhD program in systems medicine at the [European School of Molecular Medicine (SEMM)](http://www.semm.it/education/prospective-students/phd-program-systems-medicine). The next call closes in summer 2024.

We are currently looking for a computational PhD student to develop models of selection to identify novel drivers of carcinogenesis. The project will combine methods from the fields of population genetics, machine learning and network biology to create a systems biology understanding of how molecular changes act together to transform healthy into cancer cells. The successful candidate will work together with other members of the lab as well as with wet lab and clinical collaborators.

This project is related to our previous work, in particular: [Heery and Schaefer. NAR. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab1167) and [Alfieri, Caravagna and Schaefer. Nat Comm. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-39313-8).

#### Bachelor and master theses

We are always looking for **bachelor and master students** interested in doing their thesis or internships with us. Please directly contact: martin.schaefer@ieo.it.


#### The workplace

The European Institute of Oncology (IEO) is one of Europeâ€™s leading cancer research institutes. The lab is in the Department of Experimental Oncology (DEO), which is located on the IFOM-IEO campus in a central location of Milan. The IEO hosts an international and vibrant research community (with a growing computational component). It is strong in genomics analyses, clinical aspects and mechanistic understanding of cancer. The IEO has an excellent HPC infrastructure and core facilities. The institute and the lab provide a collaborative and diverse work environment. The working language is English.
